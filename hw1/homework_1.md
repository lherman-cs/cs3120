# Homework 1

1. Consider an arbitrary string *s* made up from the alphabet "a" through "z" (no other symbols and no blanks). Design a Divide and Conquer algorithm to compute MinPal(s). You will write a complete paragraph explaining the principle of your algorithm (provide the recursive formulation you use). Then write a complete pseudo code of your algorithm with enough comments and declarations of the data structures you use.
